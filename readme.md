# Hi, I’m Mahesh 👋  
**BI Manager | Data & Analytics Leader | Pragmatic Problem Solver**

I’m a Manager of BI & Reporting with 10+ years of experience building **reliable, real-world data systems** that support high-impact business decisions. I currently lead a **9-member global BI team at Saks Global**, working across retail functions to turn ambiguous problems into scalable analytics and automation.

I believe complexity must earn its place. The best solutions are often the ones that prioritize **reliability, clarity, and business value** over technical hype.

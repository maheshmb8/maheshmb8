## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🧍 Pose Angle Intelligence
A computer vision pipeline that classifies human image orientation using:
- MoveNet pose estimation  
- CLIP image embeddings  
- PCA + LightGBM classification  

Designed to generalize well to **completely unseen images**.

👉 Repo: `pose-angle-intelligence`

---

### 🖼️ Broken Image Detection
A production-style pipeline to detect:
- Broken or unreachable images  
- Placeholder / grey images  
- Duplicate images  
- Blurry and low-quality assets  

Built with a strong emphasis on **reliability, scale, and recoverability**.

👉 Repo: `broken-image-detection`

### 🌐 Digital Resume
An interactive, web-based resume showcasing projects and experience in a clean, modern format.

👉 Repo: `digital-resume-mahesh`

---

## 🎯 What You’ll See Here
- Small number of **intentional, well-documented repositories**
- Real engineering patterns, not toy examples
- Code that reflects how systems behave in practice

Hi, I’m Mahesh 👋

BI Manager | Data & Analytics Leader | Pragmatic Problem Solver

I’m a Manager of BI & Reporting with 10+ years of experience building reliable, real-world data systems that support high-impact business decisions. I currently lead a 9-member global BI team at Saks Global, working across retail functions to turn ambiguous problems into scalable analytics and automation.

I believe complexity must earn its place. The best solutions are often the ones that prioritize reliability, clarity, and business value over technical hype.

🧭 What I Focus On

Solving business problems end-to-end, not just building models

Choosing simple, explainable approaches before reaching for ML

Shipping systems that teams can trust, maintain, and actually use

🏗️ Leadership & Ownership

Leading and mentoring cross-functional BI teams (9+ members) across Planning, Supply Chain, Digital Ops, and Finance

Establishing shared intake, prioritization, and ownership to reduce delivery risk and escalations

Coaching teams to favor stakeholder engagement, progress visibility, and solution clarity over one-time delivery

Building analytics that measure success in hours saved and decisions improved, not lines of code
